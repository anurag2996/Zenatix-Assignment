### Probelm Statement:

1.   Identify patterns/trends in the data?
2.   Which AC was used the most/least?

### Optional (Bonus questions):

1.   Relate this power data with the outside temperature of Gurgaon. (Feel free to use temperature data from any website online. How will you fetch that data in your analysis?
2.   Using the power data, predict/forecast the power consumption? <br/>

### Key Insights
1. AC 18 is using maximum power which is 567739.75
2. AC 5 is using minimum power which is 124875.69
3. Thursday seems to be the day of highest usage (maybe more family functions or corporate meetings)
4. Weekends are amaong the lowest consumption group
5. May be this hotel is hosting many corporate meetings therefore the weekends observe less consumption.
6. More usage is observed during 9 pm - 6 am (maybe due to continous usage of ac during night while sleeping)
7. This trend is common amaong hotels so nothing unusual <br/>

### What can be Furthur Done?
1. We can try and collect data for hotel occupancy and events and relate it with ac_data.
2. Power outage or any environmental activity in that area can also be used to relate.
3. We can also use Deep Learning models like LSTM for forecasting.
4. We can use GridSearchCV for better hyperparameter tuning.
